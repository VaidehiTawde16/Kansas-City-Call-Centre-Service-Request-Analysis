# Kansas-City-Call-Centre-Service-Request-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing over 1,000 records from Kansas City’s 311 service requests. The goal was to improve data integrity, streamline the ETL process, and visualize actionable insights related to urban services and trends. The project utilized Alteryx for data profiling, Microsoft SQL for data staging, and Power BI/Tableau for visualization.

## Tools & Technologies

Alteryx: Used for data profiling and identification of key data integrity issues.

Microsoft SQL Server: Designed and implemented an ETL pipeline for efficient data staging.

Power BI & Tableau: Developed interactive dashboards to visualize service trends and urban dynamics.

Statistical Analysis: Conducted data interpretation to inform strategic planning for Kansas City’s public services.

## Key Features

Data Profiling:

Analyzed over 1,000 records from Kansas City’s 311 service requests.
Identified and addressed key data integrity issues to enhance accuracy.

ETL Pipeline Development:

Built a robust ETL pipeline to stage urban data into a Microsoft SQL database.
Ensured seamless data availability for future querying and reporting needs.

Data Visualization:

Developed comprehensive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau.
Visualized key urban service trends and response efficacy metrics.

Urban Life Insights:

Performed statistical analysis on staged data to interpret urban life trends.
Supported Kansas City’s strategic planning and operational improvements in public services.

## How to Use
Data Extraction: The dataset from Kansas City’s 311 service requests can be downloaded from the city’s open data platform.

ETL Pipeline: Use Alteryx to clean and profile the data. The pipeline stages the data into a Microsoft SQL database for further analysis.

Visualization: Connect Power BI or Tableau to the staged database to explore various dashboards showing urban service response trends.

Analysis: Use statistical tools to interpret the data trends and generate reports for strategic decision-making.

## Future Work
Automating the ETL process for real-time data staging.
Integrating additional urban datasets to expand the scope of analysis.
Further refining visualizations to cover more detailed response times and service types.
